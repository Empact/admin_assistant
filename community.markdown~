We have a mailing list over at [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/admin_assistant). If you have a question, please consider asking it there instead of a direct email, so that the next person who has that question might find an answer just by Googling it.

admin\_assistant is being used on the following sites:

* [boundlessny.com](http://www.boundlessny.com/) by [Michael Celona][mcelona]
* [casahelga.com](http://casahelga.com) by [Alex Farrill][afarrill]
* [sling.com](http://www.sling.com) by [Diversion Media](http://www.diversionmedia.com/)
* [stockblotter.com](http://stockblotter.com) by [Alex Farrill][afarrill]

If you're also using admin\_assistant, and would like to be listed here, please get in touch with us on through the mailing list.
